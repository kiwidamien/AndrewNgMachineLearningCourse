# Assignments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on coursera

All these files are currently implemented in Octave, as this was the language submissions could be made in.
Current **TODO**: Translate into Python.

1. **Exercise 1: Linear regression**

   Simple linear regression using gradient descent on multivariate data.
   
   Python implementation: *not done*

2. **Exercise 2: Logistic regression**

    Logistic regression, classification into classes, feature mapping, regularization, and plotting the decision boundary.
    
    Python implementation: *not done*
    
3. **Exercise 3: Using neural network**
 
    Introduction to neural networks to make predictions. Write a classifier for handwritten digits (using the *MNIST* dataset).
    
    Python implementation: *not done*
 
4. **Exercise 4: Training neural networks**
 
    Training a neural network. Uses the same *MNIST* dataset as exercise set 3. One goal is to write some notes that tidy up Ng's lecture notes. He uses the convention normal data science convention that each observation uses a row, but all the lecture notes use the standard (math) convention of using column vectors.
    
    Python implementation: *not done*
    
5. **Exercise 5: Learning curves**
 
    Diagnosing learning algorithms, in particularly using "learning curves" to distinguish between _high bias_ and _high variance_ cases.
    
    Python implementation: *not done*
    
6. **Exercise 6: Support Vector Machines**
 
    Introduction to support vector machines as a classification algorithm. Three cases were analyized: an artifical data set that could be linearly separated, a complex 2D dataset that used a Gaussian kernel, and a "real world" spam classification example.
    
    Python implementation: *not done*
    
7. **Exercise 7: _k_-means and PCA**
 
8. **Exercise 8: Anomoly detection and recommender systems**
